        <h4>About huskies:</h4>
   
    <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/animal/Siberian-husky">
    Siberian husky, breed of working dog raised in Siberia by the Chukchi people, who valued it as a sled dog, companion, and guard. It was brought to Alaska in 1909 for sled-dog races and soon became established as a consistent winner. A graceful dog with erect ears and a dense, soft coat, the Siberian husky stands 20 to 24 inches (51 to 61 cm) and weighs 35 to 60 pounds (16 to 27 kg). It is usually gray, tan, or black and white, and it may have head markings resembling a cap, mask, or spectacles. The breed, kept pure for hundreds of years in Siberia, is noted for intelligence and a gentle temperament.</blockquote>
